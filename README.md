# Homology-based classification of accessory proteins in coronavirus genomes uncovers extremely dynamic evolution of gene content


This repository contains supplementary material for the following paper: “ Homology-based classification of accessory proteins in coronavirus genomes uncovers extremely dynamic evolution of gene content” by Forni et al.

For each coronavrius subgenus, an XLS file is provided with a list of orthogroups (https://doi.org/10.1186/). Each row contains ORFs belonging to a single orthogroup. Viral species are organized in columns.
FASTA files for each orthogroup are listed in subfolders, with the amino acid sequences and name/ genomic location for each ORF in the corresponding orthogroup.
